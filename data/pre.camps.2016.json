For 10 years, we have produced exquisite themed bronze pendants that are embellished and personalized with colorful resin inlay. For Da Vinci's Workshop, we are proud to present the historical 1627 Florin coin, from the Republic of Italy. Originally struck in gold, ours is gold colored in rich bronze. Hand carved in green wax by Sumner Silverman, one side displays the beautiful \"fleur-de-lis\" symbol. The reverse, is St. John the Baptist, outlined in negative space cells for the resin. BM 2016 is carved on the side of the coin. This project and the stories we learned about other jewelry for the last two years, was the inspiration for the book \"Jewelry of Burning Man\", published in 2015. We teach every day for 3 hours per day."

But because of his second horn, he was laughed at by other unicorns, his wish-hole largely overlooked by creatures seeking tru magic.\r\nFinally, on his 4th birthday he met the Horny Camp. Horny campers knew that two horns are better than one, and an unlimited number of horns is better than two. They loved Twinkii the twini-corn and both of his magical horns and his wish-hole. Together, Twinkii and his new friends, embarked on a great journey to enlighten the public on the subject of safe horn making, horn maintenance and... magic."

We plan to offer: \r\n\u25cf\t60 seconds or more of Intentional Gazing. \r\n\u25cf\tFive Minutes or more of Focused Listening. \r\n\u25cf\tGenerous Hugs - just as long as each visitor wants. \r\nOur camp members will offer these services Noon to 6 PM daily (or pretty much any time we're in our big round public living room). We want to empower and encourage our campers and visitors to continually offer these same three tokens of human contact. \r\nWe are an international group of campers. A few of our campers plan to get the \"self-Guided Art Tour\" document (in English) from The ARTery and use that document to lead Art tours in their native language.

Our stage, is the SAVAGE ARENA - an environment that breathes with its performers and cradles its listeners. Find shelter from the wind, dust and sun inside its robust structure and flexible skin. Find an elevated perch to watch the sun rise and set through the horizon. Find a hammock to sleep or a daybed to rest. Find a bocce ball, give it a toss. Find a beer to shotgun, and some tits to motorboat. Find a jungle gym and climb. Find a wheel with questionable dares, and spin it. And while you're exploring, listen to our music, watch our lights, find your friends, and lose your minds -- together."

The Station also has a FM radio station at 90.9 on the dial to send communiqu\u00e9s to other planets.  Our team consists of multiple scientists, philosophers, physicians, and engineers who give lectures on planetary sciences, biology, neuroscience, and more.  A portable lab is set up for conducting experiments in chemistry and biology, to help educate travelers on terraforming technologies they'll need in their emigration. In the evenings we have a rocket fire sculpture for keeping warm in the harsh moon climate."

Over the next 5 years, we will be investigating each of these strange lands, then reconvening back here to tell of our adventures.\r\n\r\nWhile our travels instilled in us a breadth of knowledge, the catharsis of adventure has left us with a desire to share our experiences with the world. Through workshops, lectures, performances, and merry making, our mission is to educate you in the ways of these 5 mysterious and foreign lands.  In addition to daily and nightly events, we will also be serving food and drink which we have discovered along the way.  And what of your travels?  Do you have stories to share with us?

To envision and prepare the world of tomorrow we need to rewire our nervous systems and free ourselves from the old paradigm. Tantra is an accelerator of evolution. The context of Burning Man serves as an amplifier to these ancient Tantric techniques. The collective ambition towards freedom present during Burning Man is unique. It erases differences between individuals and supports the Tantric effort of transcending all false dualities. From regular morning energetic practices to one-of-a-kind ceremonies and ritual, Tantra Mantra embraces and promotes the change towards a new human agreement. We leave a great place for spontaneity... Expect the unexpected."

When we pursue the light we use movement, the senses, sensuality, sexuality and connection.  This beckons us in and brings the light of awareness back into the bodies we have vacated. We are particularly interested in the seat of power and intention housed in our bodies. To go there fully requires confronting our shadows. We embrace those as well as we dive into shame, fear, anger, unsavory memories from this life and past lives, and disempowering images of our bodies. Welcome home."

If you need/want a massage or something to drink or eat, our renaissance men and women are here to serve you, and with Laughter Yoga plus Longevity Stick exercises to get your Xi flowing like the Playa wind blows - - and so much more.  It's our ninth year on Playa, and with our new name.  Formerly \"Cartoon Commune,\" we felt inspired by DaVinci's inventiveness to blend his genius with that of the Fab Four.  No kidding!  You'll see our \"hill\" where you can be a fool on it; maybe even a periscope for peering out at octopuses and who knows what else at BRC.  The third dimension is yours; we've got the glasses for it - and the views to go with 'em.  Our week will include over 50 hours of interactive, inventive entertainment.  Need a home at home?  Check us out."

The disc course will be open for play all of the burn, with LED discs for night play. The forest will be made different fun obstacles and will include 15' tall tye-dye trees to 10' tall mushrooms to dozens of 3' mushrooms, all of which will  light up bright for the fairies to prance through deep into the night."

How have YOU changed?\r\n\r\nWICKEDLAND brings your favorite childhood fairytale heroes and their archetypal stories back to life. But something has changed \u2013 this world isn't nearly as innocent as it was when you were younger, because you are it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to dig deeper through the world of twisted fairytales, you are welcome to sit with a book in our cozy lounge. Or climb up the castle towers that adorn the entrance to our camp. You can be transformed to the damsel in distress of your choice. Will you be Snow White today, or maybe Rapuntzel?\r\nBut be warned \u2013 a transformation lingers behind every page you turn. If you're not careful, you may leave WICKEDLAND as Gay Donald Duck or Nymphomaniac Snow White.\r\n\r\nThere are no observers here, come party like the Princess or Dragon that you are!"

Exploring the mystical realms within and without, we stalk the many-faced prey of the One - we are the flock and the fledging, the church and the people, the dungeon and the steeple. We explore the ever-emerging edge of intimate truth and togetherness. Before, during, and after, we dance.\r\n\r\nBy day, we play with reverent abandon and reckless devotion in honor of each other - and what we create when we turn our heartbeams to a dynamic and fluid center. We serve homemade kimchi by the arched fingerful and deliver fresh, happy juices into keen mouths. By night, we play with spontaneity and serendipity, drunk only on the magic of connection and juice. The dome becomes a place to mellow out and venture into the frontierlands of mind, body, and spirit where we, the Hunting Party seek the We in You."

From high and low, everyone knows that there is no better way to chill on the playa than a cool, shaded hammock.  Come ye unto the Hang Out.\r\n\r\nThe playa is a heavy load to carry, we know.  There is much work to do.  Inter-dimensional neverlands of sublime witchery don't just dance themselves into existence.  Someone has to stack the vibes.  Someone has to wire skulls onto shit.  And after a day/night/day of labors, you need to recharge.  Come ye then unto the Hang Out.\r\n\r\nThe hammock is an ancient technology, simple and perfect.  Tension, elevation, motion.  Perfect harmony between ground and air.  A dusty burrito drifting through the continuum.  The crucible wherein soulmates are alloyed.  A great place to take a nap.  Come ye unto the Hang Out."
