Spirit Dream is our home, where our heart is and we hope you will join us.  Stop by and we'll fill your water, stay a bit and enjoy our expresso, a while longer and you will start to transform.  Feel the strength bubbling up from the land and the refreshing rain falling from above.  We will look to see your original design and embrace it with you.  We will speak life to that which was lost and bring healing to that which was broken.  We come to the playa to see you, to meet you, to embrace you, and to release you into something far greater.  Come and let us serve you and your purpose on the Earth.  We can't wait to see you...",

We are proud to have spent over 15 years serving Black Rock City in this capacity.\r\nWe have hand tools, power tools, nails, nuts, bolts, tape, string, wire, paint, bike tools, automotive tools, glue, rivets, and whatever else we can manage to fit on the truck. We enjoy helping people work on art projects and helping camps who have suffered structural difficulties, but we also help with minor automotive problems, generator issues, and fix an inordinate amount of bikes. Whatever people bring us, we\u2019ll try and fix if we can. We do not have lots of raw building materials such as 2x4s, PVP pipes, or plywood, but do have a need/want bulletin board for people who have excess or are looking for such to communicate their needs. The Playa often provides!",

Tea is something close to our hearts in the UK, but is also a significant to many different cultures; whether it is a tall iced glass of sweet tea in the southern US, or a steaming cup of mint tea served from a silvery teapot in Morocco- all are symbols of hospitality and friendship bringing us closer as a whole. We took a lot of inspiration from the Book of Tea written in 1906 by Okakura Kakuz\u014d of Japan in English, he addressed the growing concern of clash between the east and west cultures. The struggle he speaks of resonates with the modern cultural issues facing society, the very issues that Burning Man explores.",

We dare you to come sit in the Bad Advice Chair. You may even find yourself in the middle of an impromptu flow jam or fire spinning session.

Our response is that humans can discover their true nature through yoga and meditation. Self-discovery is a process of lighting up the mythic metaphor of the \"rainbow bridge.\" Anodea Judith writes that \"on our journey through life, the chakras are the wheels along this axis that take the vehicle of the Self along our evolutionary quest, across the Rainbow Bridge, to reclaim our divine nature once again...to restore the Rainbow Bridge is to reconnect to our own divinity, anchoring it in the world around us and healing the rifts that so plague our world.\"\r\n\r\nIn interacting with other burners, we would like to focus on 7 chakras over 7 days. We will offer a daily practice tied to each Chakra leading up to the lotus / crown / diamond chakra the day the man burns.",
