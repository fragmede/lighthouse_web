Passing through the center of the portal reveals one's reflection now compressed by the inner concave nature of these mirrored walls. Two lighted buttons inside the portal activate a random set of verbal instructions for successful identity reorganization.\r\nIdentity Reorganization Portal is designed to be a gauntlet thrown down before the apparent solidity of the assumed \"I\".",

Using optical lenses in the eyes, the head is a stereoscopic camera obscura that focuses light from the outside and projects an image onto the back surface of the room. Participants are given 3D glasses to give the image depth with the perspective of a giant being.  The field of vision of the projected image is nearly 180 degrees vertically and horizontally, which gives the viewer a sense of immersion.

It contains many layers of interaction: viewing from afar, entering, playing the light field, and finally, using the light field as an instrument. The structure is made of triangular boxes of metal. On the interior-facing side, each box is outfitted with a laser cut back lit panel. The lights take input from simple buttons mounted in the center of various panels. With input, the panel alters the lighting scheme. Each press spreads effects and color across the surrounding panels, allowing for interplay between participants. Enunciation is a meditation on learning how to articulate oneself. The sculpture's primary function is to create an instrument for shared interaction, which offers more articulation with increased input of people and their time. Enunciation offers a strange way to communicate, but with practice, much can be articulated without speaking.",

        "description": "TRASPARENZA, Temple of Transparency, celebrates emerging from darkness into light. It is an experiential installation that takes a chapel-like form, that Burners can enter and enjoy both inside and out. It is a playful and whimsical tribute to the genius of Leonardo da Vinci and the glories of the Italian Renaissance, a Florentine Folly. The structure is totally transparent, made of clear cast acrylic panels exquisitely laser-cut with intricate imagery. The words 'Saper Vedere', meaning 'knowing how to see', line the entrance. This was the phrase Leonardo used to describe the dominant skill of his own genius and the transparent installation plays with this notion.TRASPARENZA is a humanist chapel celebrating human endeavour and creativity, and the artist as inventor, where Burners form a colourful congregation visible to everyone outside. At its heart stands a completely see-through sculpture, \"Vitruvia\", that explores the concept of 'Divina Proportione' using the body of a woman rather than a man.",

Participants breathe life into the fire vortex by pedaling the bike-fan. Participants can shape the vortex, alter its rotation, width, height and intensity by varying their pedaling speed and adding bursts of propane via a handlebar mounted \"booster\" button.  RotoFuego will also serve as a gathering spot on cold playa nights -- a place for comfort and conversation, an opportunity to rest, warm up and make new friends.  The fire will be surrounded by benches for folks to sit upon and interact with one another and enjoy the flaming beauty their fellow participants create.",

The pieces are stencilled with inspiring sentences, and dynamically lit by LED strips during the night time. In line with this year's theme, the piece is reminiscent of Leonardo's Vitruvian Man's movement and helicoid inventions as well as his deep, systematic, understanding of the rules behind form to create art. From a wooden flame all the way to a giant desert cactus, the complex simplicity of the art piece will trigger many interpretations, many dreams. The audience will read and discuss the poetry written on each tangent coming from the Burners' community itself via our crowd funding campaign like a collage of sentences creating a serendipitous \"cadavre exquis\" of thoughts.",

A gentle push will cause the rotation  to simulate the movement of a school of sharks, swimming lazily in a rising spiral current. My goal is to underline the contrast of the beauty of schooling sharks in their ocean community, and the wasteful horror of shark finning by the human community.\r\nFrom a distance, the low profile of the turntable will show the school, to draw the playa community closer until the view is of the small cloud of sharks from below. Here will be placed the Ghost Shark on its back, as if lying finned and dead on the bottom in stark contrast to the live animals swimming above.",

        "description": "Ascension is a reflection of one person's journey of self-discovery pertaining to love. For many, the concept of being \"in love\" is defined by default society. Romantic plots in pop culture so often have characters falling in love uncontrollably to finally find \"happiness\". Society teaches us that the responsibility of our happiness lies on the shoulders of others. We spend so much time looking for happiness - love - everywhere but the one place we'll find it: within ourselves.\r\nAscension conveys a new definition of love: when separate, whole individuals form a partnership that reinforces their individuality while creating a unit where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Each person is growing as a whole individual first and foremost. The partnership reinforces this while bringing them both to a higher level, together. Through this symbolism, Ascension creates a space that inspires people to reflect on self love, loving others, and love as it relates to their world at large.",

The sign itself is made out of reclaimed sheet metal and discarded letters from dismantled corporate signs, hand painted, lit by 300 ten-watt incandescent bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels (and sometimes, pedal-power) so the piece is fully mobile across the playa. You can usually find the BORING sign accompanying burns, alongside popular art projects, and framing the silhouette of the Man at sunset. With four 500-watt speakers and a playlist of danceables from the 60s, 70s and 80s, the mobile, rolling sign often attracts an entourage of sunset or late night boogie revelers.",

This is how we learn compassion and love.\r\nIt is interactive as a meditation or hang out place, people can also stand in the middle of the portal where the symbol of infinity knot exists and experience sunlight, starlights, reflected lights or fluorescent lights, depending on the time of the day. You can also just hang out between the wings of the space, watching the flickering lights, as it creates a magical environment either at day or night.\r\nThe size of the installation will be about 28' in diameter and 12' tall.

Inside, five glass women stand holding space in a healing circle of the feminine.  Come enter this transformational arena - a circle of glass!  Hand-cast thick blocks of glass, sculpted with reliefs of the female form and arms outstretched in compassion,  welcome Participants. The circle they surround seems closed, yet calls you to duck under to enter. Overhead are spirit-charged oil paintings of soul stirring imagery, continuing the healing work of this place.  Bells blow on the wind overhead.  The space is alive, pulsing. At times it will be a quiet healing meditative space and other times there will be drumming, rattling, journeying, ritual, or even ecstatic dance for those who dare join in, or just watch and be changed.  Find your center, your Axis Mundi.",

For instance - recycled shovel heads make up the breast plate for the belly of the dragon! Come out and see for yourself.

It is unclear as to the exact reason for this behavior, however, it is speculated that he did it to unleash his writer's block and tap into undiscovered portions of his brain. Leo speculated that using his non dominated hand and writing backwards would unleash new creative portions of his brain and therefore push creativity to the ultimate boundaries of the brain. I would like to create a block or canvas for the artist of Black Rock City to exercise and flex this backwards and non dominate creative muscle. The project is  a block like structure with a negative space block (see pictures). Paint pens hang from the ceiling for participants to write on the wooden, primed and painted structure with their non-dominate hand, backwards. From the doorway will hang a sign with a riddle alluding to the directions. The structure will burn.",

Cables descending from the top of the cone carry 3600 individually controlled LEDs. Inside the cone are interactive widgets constructed mostly out of repurposed objects. Manipulating the widgets causes patterns of light to appear and move across the LEDs. Spinning wooden wheels causes stripes to move around the cone and collide to create seemingly random combinations of color. Other widgets create sparkles, stain the cone with blotches that expand and disappear, or twist and turn the whole display.",

The labyrinth provides a contemplative experience on the playa, a special place where participants can take as long as they like to walk individually or with others on the intertwining circular paths representing the miraculous synchronicities of Consciousness, Life, Earth, Universe. Just beyond the colorful pinwheels and flags of the labyrinth, the artist/scientist/mystic in you can view the fascinating panoply of creativity on the playa. Within the labyrinth, participants find a calm center, a space for musing and meditation, or a peaceful moment of At-Onement. In a magical box at the base of a large Cleu, participants may find a clue to their own lives or even be led to CleuCamp where they can get a polyphonic Cleu brainwashing & copper Cleu pendant.",

Studies have shown owning a pet helps anxiety, depression, stress, lowers blood pressure, and regulates heart rate. As is true with any relationship, some human-pet relationships are likely to be more rewarding than others. Some people are more attached to their pets than others and those feelings could influence the impact of the pet on the person's health and life.\r\n\r\nThe rocketship will have engraved writing dedicating this project to all those who has lost a pet and all the cats who have decided to leave us reminding them they are always with us. \r\n\r\nMy hope is that when people discover this installation out in deep playa, they will be touched with this install reminding them of their lost loved ones and providing humor to all the cat lovers.",

A tombstone receptacle sits on the side to collect the empty eggs. \r\n\r\nThis piece is an oasis of light in the darkness. From it, individuals carry sparks of light out to the rest of the playa.

Year after year, after returning home to Alabama from this Burning Man. I would feel so inspired but unable to take the next step in becoming part of it by creating art of my own. \r\n\r\nThis project is much bigger than just an oversized guitar; this is the beginning of an ongoing effort to generate creativity in my hometown and all over the South. I want to show people that creative thinking and actually creating is easier than one may expect, and eventually get into a position to help them reach their goals; just as you are here to help me with mine. I want to inspire others not only to think creatively, but to get out and do something about it. Help me show others that THEY CAN!",

This ~6 ft wind sock, made of rip-stop nylon, will be hand-dyed and painted with this message, and mounted securely on a pole on the open playa. With a little playa magic, maybe Ken will see it.

By capturing the movement of the pendulum, three projectors draw an identical image in light on every side of the structure. This project's goal is not only to put the participant on display, but to involve them in creating a continually changing art piece. The amazing thing about the human element is that it is inherently random and by harnessing this, our project ensures that the same pattern can never be created twice unless by a robot in controlled circumstances. What this means is that each participant will be involved in not only creation, but synthesis, creating something completely new that cannot be replicated which represents each persons individuality in a aesthetically pleasing way.",

Inside, viewers experience the waves of light wash over them and see the patterns move and shift all around them. At times, the Starfield beckons participants to play, responding to their location and movement. All the while, it plays relaxing, ambient music, creating a whimsical, calming oasis of light and sound.",

Thirdly, Canis lupus means wolf - the wolf at the bottom of the bow, will be howling at the moon.  \r\n\r\nThe piece is a 10' x 6' x 4'.  The bow is on a rotating base with a wolf howling at the moon under the bow.  The piece is made from scrap metal from various family ranches.  The tip of the arrow, the feathers, and the wolf's eye are made of copper by a fellow burner.",

Participants ascend a wobbly orchard ladder to tend the wooden cauldron of fire crackling deep into the carving. From the rim they will drive or suppress the flames with water and Burner breath, both through copper tubes as Firemeister Timeless barks! The fire will be visible across the playa so watch for it mid to late week, right up close to the temple on 12:00 ... as the driving winds permit...",

From a distance it may not be clear what we are looking at but as we approach it becomes instantly clear what this is. First we step into a loosely fenced area that is for pedestrians only where all of the Gas Giants are whirling above us. As we get closer to the Sun we can see the Rocky Planets at eye level spinning around their orbits around the Sun. It is now time to step up onto the catwalk via 4 staircases that lead up to an elevated walking area where we can really view the complex mechanics, feel the heat from the Sun's fire effect and see the orbiting Rocky Planets, now slightly below us and separated by a handrail so that we do not disturb their delicate orbits.",

The form of the  structure is inspired by Donald Ingber's research on eukaryotic cell construction and biomechanics.

Thus it becomes a more powerful & versatile object. The old & the new meld together: mechanical linkages & controls work in concert with computationally intense algorithms creating a delightful musical instrument for everyone.\r\nThis goes beyond the limitations of expectation for the original; music boxes usually play one short tune.  Here is shown that things do not always behave according to one's expectations. \r\nThe viewer is the catalyst necessary to fulfill its potential, becoming an integral component of the creative process. They become the artist, only one that is making a unique, ephemeral creation, the music, by means of their input & operation, all played out on the canvas of our device for the delight & appreciation of  all around them.",

Vibration as the main expression attempts to point at the interconnected nature of the universe. Sunrise, Sunset, and colored light animate painted climbable surfaces. The top half of an S curve is produced by combining 28 wooden boxes acting as resonating chambers for the harp portion into a curved climbable staircase. The bottom part of the S curve is steel pipe bent into multiple curves and welded together producing a flute like instrument for the wind, and a percussive instrument for human interaction. LED spot lights with slowly phasing color create animated night views with the painted portions of the instrument. Citizens interact with Vibraj by climbing on, viewing changing color patterns, plucking, strumming, singing with, and pounding out rhythms. Designed to give the wind a voice Vibraj expresses via the elements.",

Radical Self Reliance: Trash fence. Lincoln log style DIY bench\r\n5. Radical Self Expression: Two benches facing each other with rotating speaking/listening horns mounted on sticks in between them\r\n6. Communal Effort: An ornate and regal carrying litter provides an elegant sitting space\r\n7. Civic Responsibility: A small shelter holds a safe space for the weary traveler with 3 low benches and a table\r\n8. Leave No Trace: A clear plexiglass bench sits in the center of a light up zen garden\r\n9. Participation: What is a Teeter-Totter if not a huge communal bench?\r\n10. Immediacy: This bench is mobile.

Portraits, beauty, free speech, etc. coupled with guidance in assembling into vision when needed by the Guild artists! It's okay to handle, tool, and work and arrange\u2026 and see, and do! PLACEMENT in the moment, because YOU say so, and the magnetism used by the assemblage artist, interacts with the whole of this epicenter of Guild creativity. Art created can be taken, given away, picked up later, or labeled 'free' for anyone to take.

        "description": "The Tower of Ascension (TOA) is a 40' steel tower that looks like something out of ancient Babylon. It has a strong symbolic presence that will be a beacon of light on the Playa. The tower itself is comprised of a three-legged base, on which rests an observation platform at 25'. Above this is a floating metal sphere with two dragons climbing up it. The dragons have their necks intertwined at the top and will spit fire at night. \r\nA 12' wooden tower will rest about 80' from the TOA. This tower will serve as a platform for Andrea Brook's Sonic Butterfly, a newer version of the Earth Harp. \r\nA ring of 23' smaller towers surrounds the TOA, forming a perimeter and defining a space around the Tower.",

Two carvers are on duty from about 1 pm till just after sunset. One cleans up after the portrait they just carved while the other carves and/or engages the audience. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 ALL portraits are held till after sunset. At that point each image is brought forth and subjected to the kiss of the charring roof torch. This turns each portrait into an image of glowing embers reminding everyone of our brief spark. \r\n\u00a0\u00a0 They are hung inside the moop containment cage and are wire brushed in the morning, ready to be collected by the Burner who was brave enough to sit for us. They can further be adorned at other guilds, taken home as is or contributed to other burns.",

First you'll take a tour of our workshop which is embellished with drapery and a parody of Leonardo-inspired paintings (including a 20-foot mural of The Last Supper as if they were all building drums). As RECRUITS, you'll learn our history and bring an offering to our founder. As an APPRENTICE, you'll discover your Rhythmic Identity Code and we'll send you on a Rhythm Quest! Once a JOURNEYMAN, we'll teach you a few of our drum-building secrets while you help us assemble drums to gift off-playa. If you make it that far, you'll complete your apprenticeship by building a drum of your OWN to prove yourself worthy of the title \"MASTER\" within our ranks! Throughout the week, you'll find facilitated drum circles & various workshops in our play space, and there will be plenty of time for all burners to explore their own sense of play!     CALLOUT We're looking for volunteers to help facilitate drumming in our play space. We have a volunteer form on our website.

The primary workshop/classroom includes seating and work tables where visitors will learn about the Lost Triangle and make a Lost Triangle template to take with them. Visitors also will have the opportunity to learn more about geometry by assembling models.\r\n\r\nThere will be a cube based dome with built in seats and a transparent skin being used for on demand and 24/7 multi-media presentations, and the Gypsy Wagon and Car \"Rose\" made of plywood with integral slotted and notched connections, whimsical creations as if from the mind of Leonardo.",

This year, in name of \"Radical Self Expression\" we sent out five hundred vinyl toy elephants to kids all over the world and asked them to express themselves by decorating them.  We are then taking those elephants and displaying them at Burning Man under The Man as part of the Guild Workshops piazza.\r\nOur aim is to bring awareness of the importance of creativity in a child's life. Lack of funding has stopped art programs in many public schools across the country. We are figuratively and literally putting the crayon back in the child's hand. We are also bringing 10,000 elephants to the playa this year and letting burners express themselves by decorating the elephants, and gifting them to fellow burners. \r\nWe chose to create a vinyl elephant for the kids to decorate because of the elephant's outstanding memory. We are building positive experiences in children that we want them to remember for a lifetime. \r\nWe also sculpted the elephant into the shape of the Vitruvian Man, as a wink to this year's Burning Man theme.",

It was only a renewal of the vows between science and nature that saved us. The amount of horrendous  wastes we had piled up over a millenia- much of it toxic and flammable- was daunting.  The Fuocco Falene are a crux of biomech, artistry and divine intervention. Fire moths- drawn to the most noxious of wastes, able to consume the wastes and leave a benign byproduct. Their consumption of fuels is spectacular, so much so that Falena became sought after for their beauty. It has become fashionable to convert outdated civic fixtures, like fountains, to be attractions to the Fuocco Falena. Le Attrata is a prime example of such an installation, its jagged spires providing perches for the Falena, the curved benches housing seating for people, and the Falena chrysalises lighting the way throughout the night.",

Fractal arrangements of Islamic geometric patterns are cut into the outside panels, lit from within to illuminate the patterns and cast fantastic night shadows.

        "description": "The 1:44 Alcyone Portal, located at 1:44 and near the trash fence, is a continuation of the previous two years of Portals at Burning Man and the thirteenth year that Portals have been coming to Burning Man (see TransPortals.org). It is a 50 foot diameter Playa colored wall with Playa colored carpet to provide shelter and a container for the interaction of participants. It has the Vortrex wind and solar power unit in the center surrounded by an icosidodecahedron geometric stainless steel mirror structure that is the shape the Earth's grid is evolving to. It also has hidden in the wall the low frequency feedback device the Quasar Wave Transducer that vibrates the entire space with cat purring like tones as well as a high fidelity sound system to reproduce Tibetan bowls, tuning forks, vocals and other sound healing recordings. A number of other artists will be collaborating synergetically to share their talents and creativity to activate the space with installations, art, sound healing journeys, tea service, ceremonies and other consciousness evolving activities. See last years 11:55 Reformation Portal video to get an idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp-6zOlw1-c",

        "description": "Ascension is a 30ft tall three sided pyramidal structure that looks like an ancient relic recreated from some collaborative cellular memory. With three 20ft long dragons angling up its sides to a central wind powered spinning spire, this stationary temple will appear to be alive or in motion. The temples' three walls are sculpted with art Nouveau curves, psychedelic patterns and archetypal symbols that act as a type of optical illusion making those experiencing it question everything.",
